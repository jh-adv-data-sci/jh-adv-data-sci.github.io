Write an R package that implements your study planning analysis from the prior project where subjects can vary study parameters, such as inputs to the power calculator, cost per subject and so on. To do this, you will need to package your study planning code into funnctions and then package it up. The package should have documentation and a vignette that explains how to use the package. The readme to your repo should explain how to build and install the package.
