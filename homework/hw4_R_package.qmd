Write an R package that implements your study planning analysis from the prior project where subjects can vary study parameters, such as inputs to the power calculator, cost per subject and so on. To do this, you will need to package your study planning code into functions and then package it up. The package should have documentation and a vignette that explains how to use the package. The readme to your repo should explain how to build and install the package.

The package must be checked using GitHub actions.  A badge for the check must be on the README.

The packages must have unit tests.  The code coverage for this package must be over 70%.  The coverage should be checked automatically using GitHub actions and updated every time the package is checked, and requires a badge of the coverage in the README.
