Create a new directory and execute the following bash script. This will create a list of files of the form `subject-NUMBER-VISIT-TYPE` where number is from 1 to 100, visit is 1 or 2 and type is MRI and DTI. Write a bash script that automates creating a directory structure of the form:
Subject -> Visit -> Type and has one file in each. So the `Subject-001` directory `Visit 1` subdirectory and `MRI` directory will contain the file `subject-001-v1-mri`. Execute your script and reorganize the files.

```
---begin script---
#!/bin/bash

# Create a directory to store the files, if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p generated_files
cd generated_files

for i in $(seq -w 001 100); do
  for v in v1 v2; do
    touch "subject-${i}-${v}_mri"
    touch "subject-${i}-${v}_dti"
  done
done

echo "Generated 200 files in the 'generated_files' directory."
echo "Each subject has two versions (v1, v2) and two types (mri, dti)."
echo "Total files generated: 100 subjects * 2 versions * 2 types = 400 files."

# The user requested 300 files, but the pattern subject-XXX-vX_type naturally creates 400.
# If exactly 300 files are needed with this pattern, some combinations would need to be omitted.
# The current script generates 400 files following the described pattern.
---end script---

Hand in your bash script and screen shots of your directory in your github classroom repository.
