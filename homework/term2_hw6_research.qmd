## Overview  
For this assignment, you will conduct a short, independent research analysis using a dataset of your choice. The goal is to apply advanced data science methods, interpret results rigorously, and communicate findings clearly in the style of a research note.  

You may use:  
- A dataset from your own ongoing research (preferred), **or**  
- A publicly available dataset.

## Deliverable  
A **3-page written report** (single-spaced, excluding references, figures, and tables).  

Your report should include the following sections:  

1. **Introduction / Background (½ – 1 page)**  
   - Define the research question or hypothesis.  
   - Provide context and explain why the question is important in public health, biostatistics, or data science.  
   - Briefly describe the dataset you are using (source).  

2. **Methods (½ – 1 page)**  
  - Briefly describe dataset (e.g. collection, information)
  - Explain any data preprocessing or transformations.  
  - Describe your analysis methods/statistical tests
  
3. **Results (1 – 1½ pages)**  
   - Present your main findings clearly.  
   - Include at least one figure and one table (not included in 3 pages).
   - Provide inference from tests, and highlight patterns, associations, or insights that answer the research question.  

4. **Discussion & Conclusion (½ – 1 page)**  
   - Interpret your findings in context.  
   - Discuss potential biases, limitations, and assumptions.  
   - Suggest next steps for further analysis or research.  


## Formatting & Submission Guidelines  
- Length: **3 pages max** (not including references, tables, or figures).  
- Format: **PDF** document with your name on the first page.  
- Figures/Tables: Must be generated by your analysis (not copied directly from the source).
