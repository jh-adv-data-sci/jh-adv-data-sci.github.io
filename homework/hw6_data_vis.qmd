In this homework, you will create a data visualization project using a dataset of your choice. The project should include a single, hosted (on github) web page with a clear and informative visualization of the data. 

Push your code and supporting files to the github classroom repo with a link to the live visualization. Because GH classroom repos are private, the hosted web page should be in a separate public repo.
